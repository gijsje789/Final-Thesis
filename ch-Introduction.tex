\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:Intro}

\Ac{MPI}, or, simply put, the imaging of the blood flow in the heart muscle, plays an important role in diagnosing heart failure or detecting \ac{CAD}. Imaging systems like \ac{CT}, \ac{MRI}, \ac{SPECT}, or \ac{PET} can visualise a (radioactive) contrast bolus in the supplying arteries and in underlying myocardial tissue, whose flow can give an indication of narrowed or blocked blood vessels.

Many variations in the visualisation process of myocardial perfusion, including variations in hard- and software, can (significantly) influence the outcome and in turn have consequences for patient treatment. These variations need to be validated against a well-known baseline.

A myocardial perfusion phantom will be developed that is able to simulate the blood flow in the heart muscle, i.e. the myocardium, and is able to mimic cardiac defects like (significant) stenosis.

\section*{Document overview}
\label{sec:doc_overview}
\rrod{This section}
This document starts by giving a functional system overview where the drivers, the approach, the business model, functional requirements, business and system use cases, and the architectural overview are defined. 

It is followed by the technical system overview where the system is described using \cite{van2011modeling}'s methodology, and where the requirements are defined.

The appendices summarise some research articles on physiological aspects. Appendix\ref{app:physoverview} and \ref{app:physoverview_ho}summarises the research by \cite{uren1994relation} and \cite{ho2014dynamic} respectively, who defined heart rates, blood pressures, and myocardial perfusion rates for both healthy patients and patients with diagnosed CAD. Appendix \ref{app:chamber_volume} summarises the research by \cite{lin2008cardiac}, who defined the volumes of all four heart chambers and defined some dimensions of the left and right ventricle. Appendix \ref{app:chamber_volume_mac} summarises the research by \cite{maceira2006normalizedleft} and \cite{maceira2006normalizedright}, who defined end-systolic (fully compressed) and end-diastolic (fully filled) volumes of the left and right ventricles.
