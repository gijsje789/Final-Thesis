\section{Function requirements}
This section specifies the requirements set for the functions mentioned in figure \ref{fig:funcarch}.
\subsection{Generate flow}
In the project plan, a literature overview is given on perfusion phantoms, for a variety of organs, but also on physiological factors: perfusion rates, blood pressures, rates of stenosis et cetera. The TFR-GF requirements are based on the estimates by \cite{uren1994relation}, summarised in appendix \ref{app:physoverview}, \cite{chiribiri2013normal}, \cite{ho2014dynamic}, summarised in appendix \ref{app:physoverview_ho}, and \cite{slart2015pres}.
