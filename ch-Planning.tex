The works weeks can be found in table \ref{tab:workweeks} in appendix \ref{app:workweeks}.

The project planning spans 35 weeks. Activities are planned from week 49 of 2018 up until, and including, week 28 of 2019 which spans a total of 32 weeks. Week 29 will be used to finalise practical aspects, handing in material, documentation, report printing and so forth. The graduation presentation (and ceremony) will take place in week 29. Weeks 30 and 31 of 2019 can serve as an extension if, and only if, approved by the assessment- and exam committee.

The planning takes into account one week around Christmas and new-years, one week spring break ("voorjaarsvakantie") in 2019, and a two week buffer.

\section{Workdays}
The planning is based on the 28 hours
