The system requirements specify all the requirements for the myocardial perfusion phantom. These requirements are based on research and interviews with stakeholders.

\begin{table} [h]
\caption{ Table of changed requirements }
	\begin{tabular}{|c|p{0.5\linewidth}|p{0.26\linewidth}|}
		\multicolumn{1}{l}{\textbf{Requirement}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Old description}} & \multicolumn{1}{l}{\textbf{Change reason}} \\
		\hline
		TR-IC01 & A variable amount of contrast can be injected. & Rephrased. \\
		TFR-SIM01 & An \ac{AIF} must be extractable from either the aorta or the left ventricle chamber. & The AIF, in the D-SPECT software, is taken from the left ventricle. This requirement is moved to TFR-SIM04. \\
		TFR-SIM04 & Multiple chambers, or areas, should be present, such that ischaemic and non-inschaemic tissue can be visualised simultaneously. Typical software divide the heart into 17 chambers. & Rephrased due to misunderstanding of the 17 section model.\\
		TR-PR10 & The phantom's chambers must match the dimensions of an average human heart, between 60-90x30-50x60-90mm [LxWxD] & Sizes are specified for the ventricles. \\
		TR-PR02 & The phantom must be anatomically correct; four heart chambers, myocardium around the chambers, arrow shaped bottom. & Rephrased after interview at ZGT. \\
		TFR-SIM05 & Phantom's compartment model should match the currently practised protocol. Does the tracer diffuse, is it trapped in tissue et cetera. & Rephrased and linked to contrast section. \\
