		\hline
		TR-IC01 & A variable amount of contrast can be injected. & Rephrased. \\
		TFR-SIM01 & An \ac{AIF} must be extractable from either the aorta or the left ventricle chamber. & The AIF, in the D-SPECT software, is taken from the left ventricle. This requirement is moved to TFR-SIM04. \\
		TFR-SIM04 & Multiple chambers, or areas, should be present, such that ischaemic and non-inschaemic tissue can be visualised simultaneously. Typical software divide the heart into 17 chambers. & Rephrased due to misunderstanding of the 17 section model.\\
		TR-PR10 & The phantom's chambers must match the dimensions of an average human heart, between 60-90x30-50x60-90mm [LxWxD] & Sizes are specified for the ventricles. \\
		TR-PR02 & The phantom must be anatomically correct; four heart chambers, myocardium around the chambers, arrow shaped bottom. & Rephrased after interview at ZGT. \\
		TFR-SIM05 & Phantom's compartment model should match the currently practised protocol. Does the tracer diffuse, is it trapped in tissue et cetera. & Rephrased and linked to contrast section. \\
		FR03 & The high flow should be suitable for an \ac{AIF}, either in a ventricle chamber or an aorta depending on the clinical software.  & The D-SPECT software extracts the AIF in the left atrium.\\
		FR04 & Cardiac defects should be simulated such that the complex relation between stenotic and non-stenotic arteries is modelled. & Rephrased. \\
		FR05 & The phantom must be able to visualise both control and stenotic areas, similar to clinical scans. & Rephrased, it should be compatible with the 17 segment model. \\
		FR06 & The phantom must initially simulate the compartment model typically used in clinical scans, but be flexible enough such that other compartment models are achievable. & Rephrased to be more specific.\\
		FR07 & The contrast agent should be equivalent to that used in clinical scans. & Rephrased and combined with FR08 to be more global. \\
		TFR-SIM04 A) & The three coronary arteries should be present (RCA, LAD, LCx) and connected to a myocardium. & Rephrased to make it more clear. \\
		TFR-SIM04 F) & The myocardium has a longitudinal cross-sectional shape of a horseshoe. & Rephrased to be more specific. \\
		TFR-SIM04 G) &  The myocardium has a transverse cross-sectional shape of a circle. & Rephrased to be more specific. \\
		TFR-SIM04 D) & An ROI can be taken in the left ventricle. & Combined with TFR-SIM04 E), AIF is taken in left atrium. If it has poor results, the AIF's ROI can be moved to the left ventricle. \\
	TFR-SIM04 E) & An AIF can be taken from the left atrium. & Removed, combined with TFR-SIM04 D).\\
	TR-PR02 A) & In correspondence with requirements TFR-SIM04 D) and E) & TFR-SIM04 requirements were modified, therefore TR-PR02 is modified in accordance. \\
	TFR-GF03 & Minimum achievable upper limit of myocardial perfusion is 300 mL/min/100g. & Added more specificity for stress perfusion.  \\
	TFR-GF04 & Minimum achievable lower limit of myocardial perfusion is 60 mL/min/100g. & Added more specificity for rest perfusion. \\
	FR05 & The phantom must be able to visualise (and measure) the 17-segment cardiac model. & 17 active segments will be too much for the initial version. \\
	FR03* & The high flow should be suitable for an \ac{AIF} extracted from the left atrium. & Rephrased to be more specific.\\
	FR07 & The contrast protocol must be equivalent to that used in clinical scans with D-SPECT. & For SPECT, the terminology is "tracer" in stead of "contrast". \\
	TR-PR01 & The phantom, and its set-up, must fit on the D-SPECT's chair. & The phantom itself must fit on the chair and in the imaging area. However, the set-up surrounding the phantom (flow generators, measurement systems et cetera) do not necessaries \\
	TFR-ICT04 & Tracer injection is reproducible. & Tracer injection is reproducible using an infusion pump. Too much variation exists when tracer is injected manually.\\
	TR-PRT01 & The phantom is to be placed inside the QRM TRX-116, see TR-PRQ01. & The phantom's left ventricle is to be placed inside the thorax phantom as opposed to the entire phantom.\\
	TR-PRT02 & The phantom must fit on the D-SPECT seating in the imaging area. & The left ventricle must be in the imaging area as opposed to the entire phantom.\\
	TFR-GFT01 & A constant flow is to be generated, i.e. non-pulsatile. & Flow must be constant and variable.\\
